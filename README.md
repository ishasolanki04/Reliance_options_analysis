# Reliance_options_analysis
This project provides a Python-based analysis of Reliance Industries Limited (RELIANCE.NS) stock and synthetic options data from 2000 to May 15, 2025. Using the yfinance library, it performs technical analysis, generates synthetic options data, and prices them using the Black-Scholes model.  Key Features:  Technical Indicators, Synthetic Options . 
Reliance Stock and Options Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Reliance Industries Limited (RELIANCE.NS) stock and synthetic options data, covering the period from 2000 to May 15, 2025. Using Python, the project fetches historical stock data via the yfinance library, performs technical analysis, generates synthetic options data with the Black-Scholes model, backtests trading strategies, and visualizes an enhanced volatility surface. Due to the unavailability of historical options data (e.g., via Zerodha’s Kite API or NSEpy), synthetic options data is generated to simulate realistic market behavior, including volatility smiles and term structures.
Features

Stock Data Acquisition: Fetches historical stock data for RELIANCE.NS using yfinance and preprocesses it to handle missing values and outliers.
Technical Analysis: Computes and visualizes technical indicators, including:
Moving Averages (MA50, MA100, MA200)
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
Bollinger Bands
Correlation analysis between indicators and stock price


Synthetic Options Data: Generates realistic options data (ATM, ITM, OTM calls and puts) using historical volatility, implied volatility, and the Black-Scholes model, with dynamic strike price rounding.
Options Pricing and Greeks: Calculates option prices and Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega) using the Black-Scholes model, with stress testing for a 20% implied volatility shock.
Trading Strategy Backtesting: Generates trading signals based on MA, RSI, and MACD, and evaluates performance with metrics like annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown.
Volatility Surface: Visualizes a 3D implied volatility surface with simulated volatility smiles and term structures for different expiries (30, 45, 60 days).
Visualizations: Produces detailed plots for technical indicators, cumulative returns, option prices, Greeks, and volatility surfaces, saved as PNG files.

Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python: Version 3.8 or higher
Python Libraries:
yfinance>=0.2.40: For fetching historical stock data
pandas>=2.0.0: For data manipulation and analysis
numpy>=1.24.0: For numerical computations
matplotlib>=3.7.0: For data visualization
scipy>=1.10.0: For statistical functions and Black-Scholes calculations



You can install the required libraries using the provided requirements.txt file or directly via pip:
pip install yfinance>=0.2.40 pandas>=2.0.0 numpy>=1.24.0 matplotlib>=3.7.0 scipy>=1.10.0

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/reliance-stock-options-analysis.git
cd reliance-stock-options-analysis


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

Ensure you have an internet connection to fetch stock data via yfinance.

Run the main script to perform the full analysis:
python reliance_options.py


The script will:

Fetch and preprocess Reliance stock data.
Calculate and plot technical indicators.
Generate synthetic options data and compute prices/Greeks.
Backtest a trading strategy based on combined signals.
Visualize an enhanced volatility surface and save plots as PNG files.


Output files:

technical_indicators.png: Stock price with moving averages and Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD, and volume.
correlation_matrix.png: Heatmap of indicator correlations.
cumulative_returns.png: Strategy vs. market cumulative returns.
volatility_surface.png: 3D implied volatility surface.
call_prices.png: Call option prices across strikes and expiries.
delta.png: Delta values across strikes and expiries.

Notes

Synthetic Data: Due to the unavailability of historical options data, the project uses synthetic data generated with realistic assumptions (e.g., volatility smile, term structure, and historical volatility scaled by 1.2 for implied volatility).
Sticky Strike vs. Sticky Delta: The project includes a note on these concepts:
Sticky Strike: Assumes implied volatility remains constant for a given strike, leading to persistent volatility smiles.
Sticky Delta: Assumes implied volatility adjusts with the underlying price, better suited for trending markets.


Limitations:
Relies on synthetic options data, which may not fully capture real market dynamics.
Assumes a constant risk-free rate (6%) for simplicity.
Backtesting is based on historical data and may not predict future performance.



Future Improvements

Integrate real-time or historical options data from reliable sources (e.g., NSE or paid APIs).
Enhance trading strategies with machine learning or advanced statistical models.
Add support for additional Greeks (Theta, Rho) and multi-asset analysis.
Optimize performance for large datasets or real-time applications.
